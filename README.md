#include <RInclude\RTrailing.mqh>

// Initialize classes
RPositions positions;
RAccProtect accountProtection;
RTrail trailing;

void OnInit()
{
    // Initialize position management
    STRUCT_INIT_POSITIONS posInit = {
        .magic = 12345,
        .pair = _Symbol,
        .order_type_filling = ORDER_FILLING_FOK,
        .total_pos_limit = 10,
        .total_buy_pos_count_limit = 5,
        .total_sell_pos_count_limit = 5,
        .total_groups_count_limit = 3
    };
    positions.Init(posInit);
    
    // Initialize account protection
    STRUCT_INIT_ACCPROTECT accInit = {
        .pair = _Symbol,
        .magic = 12345,
        .Order_Type_Filling = ORDER_FILLING_FOK,
        .VSO_Level_inMoney = 1000,
        .VSO_Level_inPcnt = 20,
        .NB_RemoveExpert = true,
        .NB_CloseAllPositions = true,
        .VSO_RemoveExpert = true,
        .VSO_CloseAllPositions = true
    };
    accountProtection.Init(accInit);
    
    // Initialize trailing system
    STRUCT_INIT_TRAILING trailInit = {
        .pair = _Symbol,
        .magic = 12345,
        .EachPos_distance_pts = 50,
        .EachPos_trail_type = EachPos_Virt,
        .EachPos_VirtTrail_Speed = 10
    };
    trailing.Init(trailInit);
}

void OnTick()
{
    // Account protection check (first line of code)
    accountProtection.AccProtection();
    
    // Your trading logic here
    // ...
    
    // Position management
    if(positions.Total_Pos_Count_Exceeds())
    {
        Print("Position limit reached");
        return;
    }
    
    // Trailing management
    STRUCT_PARENT_POS parentList[];
    trailing.Trailing(parentList);
}
```

### Advanced Features

#### Position Grouping
```mql5
// Create parent position with comment "&Parent&"
positions.OpenMarketOrder(0.1, BUY, 50, 100, "&Parent&");

// Support positions will be automatically marked
// with comments like "&123456789&1", "&123456789&2"
```

#### Dynamic Compounding
```mql5
#include <RInclude\RDynCmpd.mqh>

RDynCmpd compounding;
STRUCT_INIT_DYNCMPD compInit = {
    .pair = _Symbol,
    .default_volume = 0.01,
    .max_volume = 1.0,
    .magic = 12345,
    .pcnt_from_account = 5,
    .cmpd_break_koef = 100,
    .cmpd_type = CMPD_STATIC
};
compounding.Init(compInit);

double newVolume = 0.01;
if(compounding.Adjust_Static_CompoundVolume(0.01, newVolume))
{
    Print("New volume: ", newVolume);
}
```

#### Risk Management
```mql5
// Check margin limits before opening positions
if(!marginLimit.Pass_Margin_pcnt_Limit())
{
    Print("Margin limit exceeded");
    return;
}

// Monitor account protection
accountProtection.AccProtection();
```

## Configuration
